The Data and Computational Resources for Research seminar took place at RSES on Thursday the 22nd of February, and was organised as part of the Data Science Research Theme. After an introduction by RSES Director Prof. Steve Eggins, Dr. Lesley Wyborn (Adjunct Fellow, ANU) gave an overview of the seminars that aimed at providing information about the computational and data resources available at RSES, and more broadly ANU, for RSES staffs and students.

During the first talk, Paul Davidson (RSES IT Manager) outlined the existing facilities at RSES for computation, data management and data backup. Then Elke Dawson (ANU Manager, Open Research) presented the various facilities that offer data management solutions at ANU, as for instance [ANU Data Commons](https://datacommons.anu.edu.au/DataCommons/). Following this, Dr. Ben Evans (Associated Director, Research, Engagement and Initiatives, National Computational Infrastructure NCI) presented the [infrastructures of NCI](http://nci.org.au/) and the various unique possibilities that it offers. This includes Virtual Desktop Interfaces / Virtual Laboratories, various geoscience data collections, without forgetting the impressive Raijin supercomputer and its 84,656 cores. Keith Russell (Partnerships Programs Manager) extended this vision to the facilities offered in Australia, such as the [Australia National Data Service](https://www.ands.org.au/) (ANDS), the [NeCTAR](https://nectar.org.au/research-cloud/) network that allows easy cloud computing or [Research Data Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/) (RDS) for managing data and software on a long term. Turning to the international scene, Lesley presented the various solutions and growing strategies that are the target of a continuous effort by several international universities and institutions, with the aim to provide reproducible and durable science in our new numeric era. This international coalition includes, for example, journals such as [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/) and [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/), [AuScope](http://www.auscope.org.au/), NCI and ANDS in Australia (non exhaustive list!). Lesley further presented the concept of the [Virtual Research Environment](http://nci.org.au/2018/02/16/new-big-data-platform-revolutionise-geoscience/), which, by putting all pieces of data and software together, allows one to perform unique and reproducible research.

The presentations highlighted data and computing infrastructure available to staff and students across RSES, the ANU and internationally. In case you missed it, all the presentation are available below.
