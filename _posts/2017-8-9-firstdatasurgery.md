Today saw the inaugural [Data Surgery](https://rses-datascience.github.io/rses-datascience.github.io/datasurgery.html) session, where we discussed the complexities of matching noisy time-series data. It was standing room only (we're going to need a bigger room!), with lots of useful questions and suggestions from all sorts of people.

In case you missed it/want to revisit the material, [everything we discussed is now online](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries/blob/master/02_ProfileMatching/02_ProfileMatching.ipynb). The show-stealing Python-themed cake, however, is not!
